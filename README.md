<strong>Hi there, I'm Girish! 👋</strong>

I'm passionate about the potential of 
<strong>
* machine learning and AI 🦾 
* combined with alternative modes of computation (i.e. quantum ⚗️)
</strong>
to change our world.

I'm excited by opportunities to learn and apply my knowledge to new technical challenges, whether they be 
<strong>
* training NLP models 📢 
* developing Android applications 💚 
* or developing CS + physics curricula for young minds 🧠
</strong>
